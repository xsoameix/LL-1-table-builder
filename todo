Integration Test: Add more func to list member of SymbolTable's gNT and gT.
Unit Test: Write more SymbolTable Test func.
addT() is not the correct semantic action, because using this will put duplicated item into the array.
The solution is using hash table (use linked list to implement). If hash collision happen, use flatten func to store it into array.
